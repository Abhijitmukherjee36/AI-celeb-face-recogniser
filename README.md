Step 4: Preprocess the images and load them from folders into training and validation datasets.

Step 5: Build a CNN model for image classification.

Step 6: Train the model on the dataset.

Step 7: Test the model by uploading a new image and predicting the celebrity.

Step 8: Visualize the accuracy to see how well the model performs.
